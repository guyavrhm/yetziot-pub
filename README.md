# Yetziot 📱

> **_NOTE:_** This app's source code is private.

Yetziot is a full-fledged mobile app developed using ReactJS and Django. It helps you keep track of when your childhood friends are back home from the army, university, or anywhere else. The app provides a convenient and easy way to stay in touch with friends and see when they're available to hang out.

## Fetures
- User-friendly interface: Yetziot has a simple and intuitive design that makes it easy for users to navigate the app and find what they need. 🌟
- Current Day and Calendar view: Easily see which of your friends are home and who's not. 📅
- Combined search: Search for when all specified friends are home together. 🔍
- Fixed home dates: Instead of entering dates each time you're home, you can enter fixed dates (e.g., every other weekend). 🏠
- Privacy settings: Yetziot allows users to control their privacy settings, so they can choose who can see when they are back home. 🔒
